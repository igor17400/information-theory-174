# information-theory-174

This work aims to help people study information theory and understand its applicability and usefulness. This repository consists of a collection of knowledge where I gather a lot of information to understand the realm of information theory. The main content is the summary "A Not-Too-Short, Not-Quite-Long Summary of *Information Theory*." I have summarized a lot of content from canonical books and added some codes and animations/visualizations using Python to better understand how information theory works.

I hope this proves useful to someone beyond myself. :)
